#         # Ensure you have a sample audio file in your test assets
#         # transcript = transcribe_audio("path/to/sample_audio.wav")
#         # self.assertIsNotNone(transcript)

#         # insights = generate_insights(transcript)
#         # self.assertIsNotNone(insights)

# For now, this file is a placeholder for future tests.
# The original `process_audio` function and its direct dependencies
# have been moved to the respective service modules.
