 is there really are in the driver's seat in terms of what type of content you're looking for or what you're looking to view. And it's the job of the content creators to get to who they are. And I say that YouTube in many ways is the most efficient way of connecting a creator like yourself with their audience wherever they are in the world. But it's the same thing. You are the one responsible for actually producing the content that's interesting to people. And I as a fan of yours am only going to watch it to the extent that I'm interested. And so that's fundamentally what happens on YouTube. And your question about what happened in the recent elections in the US, I do think that news commentators, popcasters, or whatever you want to call them play a big role in that election. And I do think that candidates got the word out as a result of engagement.
