 you know, India really is at the cost of being a true creator nation. And I get to see it from my vantage point at YouTube. I see it in the numbers, I see it obviously in everybody that I interact with whenever I'm visiting India. But I think that's the big vision. And I think what's really interesting about it is it's a mix of everything. There's obviously the cultural and creative aspect of it, but there's also the business aspect of it. What's required to be a successful creator. There's also the collaborative aspect of it. There's the private government partnership aspect. And I think waves, at least tonight understanding is trying to put all those pieces together. Content creators and politics. Do you think they're more, they're getting more ingrained than they have ever been? Well, the way I think about it is, did you vote to public in your demo? Did I, I'm not going to do that. All my pieces, I've been voted on both sides for a very long time.
